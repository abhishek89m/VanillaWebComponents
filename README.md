# Vanilla JS App

This app has been written in Vanilla JavaScript, using features under the modern Web Component specification.

Note - This app is not meant to work with Internet Explorer, as its a retired browser, with very low adoption rates in 2021.

The project is for demostrating that its possible to have a modern project structure, even without a JavaScrpt framework or a library.

## Setup

Setup is as simple as running this on a web server. The following simple http pyhton server command was used for development :
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
